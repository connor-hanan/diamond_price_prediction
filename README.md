# Project Overview
---
Using everyones favorite Diamond dataset, I was able to predict the selling price of the Diamonds in the data with a high degree of accuracy wiht the variables I was given. 
### Tools
- Python was used to transform, explore, evaluate the data, and to build the machine learning model.
  - Powershell was used to create a custom 'Conda' virtual enviroment and to install all the nessecary packages.
- PowerBI was used to visualize the data and the model results.
## Python
In the following section I'll walkthrough key points of the project as well as some of the code.

To give you an idea of what the data looks like I'll first display the first 5 rows out of the 53,940 in the entire dataset.
```python
df.head()
```
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">

To analyze the correlation of our numerical values we first create a variable that contains all numerical columns, and then we
